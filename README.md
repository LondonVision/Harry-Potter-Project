# Harry-Potter-Project
My Computer Science II final project
1. You start by creating a character by following the on-screen instructions
2. At the beginning of the game, you will only have one spell but you unlock more as you
gain XP. You gain a spell approximately every 500 XP. As the spells get more powerful, u
might need more XP before the next spell is unlocked.
3. Good Wizards start with 125 hp and can only use good wizard spells
4. Bad Wizards start with 90 hp and can only use bad wizard spells
5. Each spell has an accuracy and will hit the target that percentage of times
6. Once you exit/terminate the code all of your progress will be lost
7. The arcade battle mode allows you to battle different characters from harry potter
8. The Spells menu allows you to see your unlocked spells (which will increase as you gain
XP). You can also see all of the possible good and bad spells.
9. The statistic menu lets you see your name, hp, total hp, and XP.
10. Have Fun!
